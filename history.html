                <p>The Yorkshire Terrier (Yorkie for short) originated in Yorkshire England. At first the Yorkshire terrier was celebrated for squeezing into small places to catch rodents. It wasn't until the late 1800's were they seen as luxurious, but in those days the special Parti Yorkie was seen as odd, so they were usually put down.</p><p>The Parti Yorkie is <b>not</b> a regular Yorkie. They have a very rare colorway of black, white and tan. It is the special genetic DNA which makes them unique. The Parti Yorkie gene is a recessive trait, so the mother and the father must carry the gene to produce a Parti Yorkie puppy. Parti Yorkies are healthy breeds. After AKC (the American Kennel Club) officially acknowledged the Parti Yorkie in the year 2000, they have been highly sought after and there are not enough on the market to satisfy the demand for them. Contact us for your chance to own a Parti Yorkie! Who knows when your next chance to own one of these uncommon dogs will be?</p>
