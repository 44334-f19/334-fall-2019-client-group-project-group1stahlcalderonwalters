            <p>The Party Yorkie is a special type of Yorkie. They have a very rare colorway, and they have a special genetic DNA which makes them unique. The PartY Yorkie gene is a recessive trait, so the mother and the father must carry the gene to produce a Party Yorkie puppy. Party Yorkies are not mutts and are healthy breeds. Back in the 1800's the Party Yorkie was seens as odd, so they were usually put down ol yeller style. It wasn't until the 1980's when they were displayed in dog shows, were they seen as luxurious. Now they are highly sought after and there are not enough on the market to satisfy the demand for them. Contact us for your chance to own a Party Yorkie! Who knows when your next chance to own one of these uncommon dogs will be.</p>
